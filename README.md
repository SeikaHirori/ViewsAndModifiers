    - [x] 2. Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
        - Note: I think we're refactoring by moving the code into a ViewModifier?
            - Followed this lecture: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/custom-containers
    - [ ] 3. Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
        - Note: I think this is for Project 2?
